1. IAgentContext now provides thread-safe members 

	void SetProperty(object key, object value);
	object GetProperty(object key);

    to modify the properties collection. This provides another means for agents to
    communicate with each other.

2. Agent class has a public property called Proxy that an agent can use to obtain its own proxy.

3. WINAH now supports Windows XP themes.

4. Added a public string property Agent.AssemblyPath to provide the client code an easy way to find out the path of the agent's assembly required in the IAgentContext.CreateAgent call.

5. Allows the writing of mobile-agents in Visual Basic through Visual Studio.NET.
